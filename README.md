# NBody codes

# Code repository of Augustus Porter, aspiring astrophysicist. Contains N-Body simulations of galaxies and planetary systems. Any questions feel free to email me at augustusjdporter@gmail.com.

# I acknowledge there is a lack of documentation and commenting. This is my next task to make the code more readable.

# Be excellent to each other.
